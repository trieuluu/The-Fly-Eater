# The-Fly-Eater
The Fly Eater is a 2D interactive game implemented with Python. 


Background:

    The purpose of this group project was to implement a 2D interactive game by 
    using Python and Turtle Graphics Library. 
    
Project:

    The user in the game is represented by a Turtle which can be controlled by 
    arrow keys. Many flies are generated with random movement across the screen. 
    User needs to control the Turtle and eat all those flies. 
    When a fly is “eaten”, it turns blue and disappears. 
    The objective of this game is to eat all the flies as quickly as possible. 
    
    The Fly Eater was created based on Turtle Graphics library, 
    implementation of random features with “randrange”, 
    utilization of flag, combination of various data types, and object-oriented programming.
